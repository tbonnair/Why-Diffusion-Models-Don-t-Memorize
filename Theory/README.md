## Codes for the theoretical section

This repository contains the codes to reproduce the figures of the theory section of  **"Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training"**  by *T. Bonnaire, R. Urfin, G. Biroli, and M. MÃ©zard*.  It contains the following codes. *(In construction)*

## Description

The script solves the saddle point equations for the Stieltjes transform of the random matrix $U$, and compares the **theoretical spectral density** $\rho(\lambda)$ with **empirical histograms**.

The model assumes Gaussian data with covariance:

$$
\rho_\Sigma(\lambda) = 0.5\,\delta(\lambda - \lambda_1) + 0.5\,\delta(\lambda - \lambda_2)
$$
