## Description

The script solves the saddle point equations for the Stieltjes transform of the random matrix \( U \), and compares the **theoretical spectral density** \( \rho(\lambda) \) with **empirical histograms**.

The model assumes Gaussian data with covariance:
\[
\rho_\Sigma(\lambda) = 0.5 \, \delta(\lambda - \lambda_1) + 0.5 \, \delta(\lambda - \lambda_2)
\]
