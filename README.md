# Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training

This repository contains the theoretical analysis and numerical experiments for the paper [Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17638) by T. Bonnaire, R. Urfin, G. Biroli and M. MÃ©zard.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### [`Experiments/`](./Experiments/)
Contains all numerical experiments and computational code:
- **Environment setup**: Conda environments and dependencies.
- **Training scripts**: Implementation of diffusion models on GMM and CelebA datasets.
- **Generation scripts**: Sample from trained models.
- **Data preprocessing**: CelebA dataset handling.
- **Model implementations**: U-Net and simple residual network architectures, and diffusion utilities.

### [`Theory/`](./Theory/)
TODO: in prep., I will put the code to train an RFNN, the code to compute the eigenvalue density from the saddle point equations and the codes to do the figures maybe?
